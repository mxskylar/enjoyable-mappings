# enjoyable-mappings

Ever wanted to play games on macOS with a controller? ðŸŽ® You can using [Enjoyable](https://yukkurigames.com/enjoyable/)!

If you enjoy the same games as me, you can download custom mappings for Xinput controllers below.
Once you've installed Enjoyable, open `.enjoyable` files to import them as profiles,
or use `âŒ˜` + `O` in the Enjoyable UI.

## OpenRCT2 (Roller Coaster Tycoon)

My custom mappings for [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.org/) use the following keyboard shortcuts under the hood.
Verify that you have the same shortcuts configured in the game by selecting
`Disk and game options` > `Options` > `Controls and interface` > `Shortcut keys...`:
