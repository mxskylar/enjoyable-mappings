Ever wanted to play games on macOS with a controller? ðŸŽ® You can using [Enjoyable](https://yukkurigames.com/enjoyable/)
by [dragonfax](https://github.com/dragonfax/enjoyable). âœ¨

If you enjoy the same games as me, you can download custom mappings for Xinput [controllers](controllers.md) below.
The mappings are defined as Enjoyable profiles.

Once you've installed Enjoyable, download `.enjoyable` files from this site. To import them as profiles,
open them directly or use `âŒ˜` + `O` in the Enjoyable UI.
