Ever wanted to play games on macOS with a controller? ðŸŽ® You can using [Enjoyable](https://yukkurigames.com/enjoyable/)!

If you enjoy the same games as me, you can download custom mappings for Xinput [controllers](docs/controllers.md) below.
Once you've installed Enjoyable, open `.enjoyable` files to import them as profiles,
or use `âŒ˜` + `O` in the Enjoyable UI.
